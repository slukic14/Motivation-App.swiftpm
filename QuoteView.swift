        let quote1 = "Attitude is a little thing that makes a big difference."
        let quote2 = "Don't sit down and wait for the opportunities to come. Get up and make them."
        let quote3 = "You are never too old to set another goal or to dream a new dream."
        let quote4 = "It is during our darkest moments that we must focus to see the light."
        let quote5 = "All dreams are within reach. All you have to do is keep moving towards them."
        let quote6 = "It is never too late to be what you might have been."
        let quote7 = "It always seems impossible until it's done."
        let quote8 = "When it comes to luck, you make your own."
        let quote9 = "Your story is what you have, what you will always have. It is something to own."
        let quote10 = "A problem is a chance for you to do your best."
        
        let explanation1 = "A positive attitude can lead to motivation, resilience, and success, while a negative one can create barriers and setbacks. The “little thing” is internal, but its effects are often seen in big, external results."
        let explanation2 = "Instead of hoping that things will happen on their own, this quote urges you to be proactive: pursue your goals, develop your skills, meet new people, and take bold steps. It reflects a mindset of empowerment and self-determination."
        let explanation3 = "It serves as a reminder that it’s never too late to pursue something new—whether it’s a career, a hobby, an adventure, or a personal goal. The quote promotes lifelong purpose and the belief that dreams don’t have an expiration date."
        let explanation4 = "This quote encourages resilience—the ability to stay strong and centered when things seem bleak. It suggests that even in tough times, if we stay focused and don’t give up, we can find hope, healing, or a path through the darkness."
        let explanation5 = "The key message is that progress may be slow or challenging, but as long as you keep moving forward, step by step, your dreams can become reality. It’s a motivational reminder to stay committed and not let fear or setbacks stop you from pursuing what you truly want."
        let explanation6 = "Whether it's chasing a passion, switching careers, or becoming the person you’ve always aspired to be, this quote reminds us that the door to reinvention is never truly closed. What matters most is the willingness to begin—regardless of age or past circumstances."
        let explanation7 = "This quote reminds us not to be discouraged by the size of a task or the fear of failure. Often, what holds us back is the perception of impossibility—not the reality. With determination, effort, and perseverance, what once felt out of reach can become a real achievement."
        let explanation8 = "Rather than waiting for luck to happen, it encourages people to create their own favorable outcomes through dedication, resilience, and proactive choices."
        let explanation9 = "To “own” your story means to accept it with confidence and pride, without shame or regret. It’s a call to recognize that your past doesn’t define your limits, but rather shapes your strength and voice."
        let explanation10 = "When faced with a problem, it’s an opportunity to demonstrate your problem-solving skills, to push yourself beyond your comfort zone, and to rise to the occasion. It’s about embracing the challenge as a moment to do your very best work and to learn along the way."
