    let quote1 = "It’s not stress that kills us, it is our reaction to it."
    let quote2 = "Sometimes the most productive thing you can do is relax."
    let quote3 = "One day at a time is all we should be dealing with. We can’t go back to yesterday and we can’t control tomorrow."
    let quote4 = "You can’t always control what goes on outside. But you can always control what goes on inside."
    
    let explanation1 = "This quote encourages us to manage our reactions, adopt healthy coping strategies, and maintain perspective. By responding calmly and constructively, we can mitigate the negative effects of stress and navigate challenges more effectively."
    let explanation2 = "It suggests that constant work without breaks can lead to burnout, diminishing effectiveness over time. Relaxation, on the other hand, allows your mind and body to recharge, increasing creativity, focus, and energy in the long run."
    let explanation3 = "It encourages living in the here and now, instead of getting stuck in past regrets or worrying about future uncertainties. Life unfolds one day at a time, and trying to control everything at once can lead to overwhelm. This quote emphasizes mindfulness and the importance of dealing with life as it comes, taking small steps each day to move forward with clarity and peace."
    let explanation4 = "While external circumstances are often beyond our control, how we respond to them—our thoughts, emotions, and reactions—is entirely within our power. This quote encourages mindfulness and personal responsibility, reminding us that we have the ability to choose our attitudes, mindset, and emotional responses, no matter what life throws our way."
