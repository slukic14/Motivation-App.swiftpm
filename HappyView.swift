struct HappyView: View {
    let quote1 = "Happiness is not something ready made. It comes from your own actions."
    let quote2 = "Happiness is letting go of what you think your life is supposed to look like and celebrating it for everything that it is."
    let quote3 = "The most important thing is to enjoy your life — to be happy — it’s all that matters."
    let quote4 = "Take time to do what makes your soul happy."
    
    let explanation1 = "Rather than waiting for the supposed right situation, person, or event to make you happy, this quote reminds you that joy and fulfillment are built by how you live, how you treat others, and how you align your actions with your values."
    let explanation2 = "True happiness comes from releasing unrealistic standards or comparisons and embracing the present—flaws, changes, and all. This mindset allows us to find joy in the real moments, rather than chasing an illusion of perfection."
    let explanation3 = "By focusing on enjoyment and happiness, this quote encourages us to prioritize our well-being, relationships, and moments of fulfillment, reminding us that at the end of the day, these are what truly matter."
    let explanation4 = "This quote reminds us to intentionally carve out time for what brings us peace, passion, and purpose—whether it’s a hobby, time with loved ones, or moments of quiet reflection. By doing so, we recharge and connect with our deepest desires, fostering greater well-being and happiness."
