    let quote1 = "The greatest weapon against stress is our ability to choose one thought over another."
    let quote2 = "Silence is not the absence of something but the presence of everything."
    let quote3 = "You don't have to control your thoughts. You just have to stop letting them control you."
    let quote4 = "In the midst of movement and chaos, keep stillness inside of you."
    
    let explanation1 = "By consciously choosing positive, constructive, or calming thoughts instead of anxious or negative ones, we can reduce stress and improve our emotional well-being. This quote encourages mindfulness and mental discipline as key tools for navigating difficult situations."
    let explanation2 = "In silence, we can connect with our thoughts, emotions, and surroundings more clearly. It’s in quiet moments that we often gain insight, peace, and a sense of connection to the world or to ourselves. Silence, then, becomes a space of presence—not void, but depth."
    let explanation3 = "Instead of trying to suppress or fight every thought, this quote encourages awareness and detachment. It reminds us that thoughts are not facts, and we don’t have to act on or believe everything we think. The key is learning to observe thoughts without letting them dictate our emotions or actions."
    let explanation4 = "This inner stillness can help you respond thoughtfully rather than react impulsively, and it serves as a grounding force during stressful or uncertain times. It’s a reminder that true calm comes from within."
