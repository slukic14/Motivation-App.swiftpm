    let quote1 = "Frustration, although quite painful at times, is a very positive and essential part of success."
    let quote2 = "Do not let your anger lead to hatred, as you will hurt yourself more than you hurt the other."
    let quote3 = "Frustration is the fuel that can lead to the development of an innovative and useful idea."
    let quote4 = "When you can't control what's happening, challenge yourself to control how you respond."
    
    let explanation1 = "Rather than being a sign of failure, frustration can drive problem-solving, creativity, and persistence. It’s a natural part of the process that helps build the resilience and insight needed to achieve success."
    let explanation2 = "Hatred often consumes mental and emotional energy, creating inner turmoil and bitterness. This quote encourages reflection, forgiveness, and letting go—not for the benefit of others, but to protect your own peace and health."
    let explanation3 = "Rather than seeing frustration as a dead end, this quote encourages us to view it as a starting point—a powerful motivator that often leads to breakthroughs, innovation, and meaningful change."
    let explanation4 = "This quote encourages us to shift focus from external chaos to internal strength. By managing our responses—through patience, calm, or thoughtful action—we maintain our sense of agency and reduce the negative impact of difficult situations."
