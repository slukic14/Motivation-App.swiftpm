    let quote1 = "Don't sit down and wait for the opportunities to come. Get up and make them."
    let quote2 = "Success is not final, failure is not fatal: It is the courage to continue that counts."
    let quote3 = "The future depends on what you do today."
    let quote4 = "Believe you can and you’re halfway there."
    
    let explanation1 = "This might involve developing new skills, taking risks, or seeking out connections and experiences that lead to growth. The essence of the quote is that success and progress come from initiative, not passivity. It reminds us that we have the power to shape our own future through our efforts and decisions."
    let explanation2 = "This quote encourages a growth mindset—understanding that both successes and failures are temporary, and it’s the courage to keep trying, learning, and improving that ultimately leads to long-term fulfillment and achievement."
    let explanation3 = "This quote reminds us that the habits, decisions, and efforts we put in today lay the foundation for tomorrow’s success, growth, and well-being. It encourages mindfulness and intentionality, urging us to act with purpose and foresight, knowing that today’s actions are the building blocks of our future."
    let explanation4 = "When you believe in yourself, you’ve already overcome the mental barrier that often holds people back, making the path to success clearer and more achievable. This quote encourages a mindset of possibility, where belief becomes the driving force that propels you forward toward your goals."
