    let quote1 = "You’re allowed to be both a masterpiece and a work in progress at the same time."
    let quote2 = "It’s okay to rest, to pause, and to take things one step at a time. You’re allowed to recharge."
    let quote3 = "There is virtue in work and there is virtue in rest. Use both and overlook neither."
    let quote4 = "A tired mind is a distracted mind. Rest is a form of self-care, and it is essential to your well-being."
    
    let explanation1 = "This quote celebrates the idea that it’s okay to embrace both where you are now and where you’re headed, allowing for self-compassion and continuous development. It reminds us that we don’t have to be perfect to be valuable or worthy."
    let explanation2 = "Rest is not a sign of weakness, but a crucial component of sustained success and well-being. It encourages a balanced approach to life, where taking the time to pause and replenish your energy is as valuable as the work or effort you put in."
    let explanation3 = "While work helps us achieve goals, progress, and growth, rest allows us to rejuvenate, maintain our well-being, and ensure we can continue performing effectively. This quote encourages us to value both aspects equally and not neglect one for the other, as they each serve a vital purpose in maintaining overall health and success."
    let explanation4 = "When our minds are exhausted, we become more prone to distractions, mistakes, and poor decision-making. This quote highlights the value of taking time for self-care, recognizing that proper rest is a crucial part of ensuring that our minds stay sharp, focused, and resilient."
